It’s rss-like tech news aggregation format and community of software engineers, project managers, and other tech-adjacent commenters offers an experience lacking in most social media platforms. In some cases your browsing experience can leave you with some rare insight from a hardened industry veteran. More often than not, you end up reading some of the most insane takes from the dumbest smart people you could ever imagine. &lt;!--more--&gt;Just off the cuff, one article about math led to an argument about the semantics of zen spirituality and peeling potatoes. Honestly it’s just stunning to read what incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29999372&quot;&gt;insights&lt;/a&gt; our best and brightest knowledge workers have on life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are peeling the potatoes and have a bit of whole-hearted potato peeling and then immediately go off “wow, I was really focused there, what Zen potato peeling!” for a minute, well, those thoughts are not Zen spirituality. It’s a common problem with reading or listening to stories about whole-hearted activity - one fills up with “Zen thoughts” for a while.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this person correct? It doesn’t matter. Every article posted to Hacker News is filled with banal arguments with varying levels of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One topic that is posted on Hacker News weekly is &lt;em&gt;“Zettelkasten”&lt;/em&gt; a note taking technique where notes relate and link to each other. I can’t help mentioning one of the more psychotic systems I found in one of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://lmy.medium.com/a-tour-to-my-zettelkasten-notes-dc26a75e5257&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;: a template for a “Personal CRM” where you list out every contact you know, their relations, status, last contact, and what the last contact contained. Whoever wrote this article should really reconsider what they’re trying to accomplish here. It cannot be healthy to compartmentalize relationships like this. People are not data points on a spreadsheet to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one positive thing out of all these note taking articles. Not the note taking system itself, but a comment that really made me reflect on many areas of my life. It was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23387255&quot;&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt; to a criticism behind the intent of the system itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People love doing things that feel like work, but aren’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m terrified of picking up new systems like this without having a purpose. I could spend hours building out a graph, admiring all of MY knowledge, but not really have any intended use for it other than telling others about it and how I’m going to use it someday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reply was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re in a perceptive loop concerning this particular object (systems like this) then. You see future-self behaving as past-self did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can keep doing that, looping. People who are natural contingency planners do this all the time–they map their past onto future-self. Flexing this muscle because it’s strongest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However this is also a good way of preventing yourself from re-exploring new objects through a different lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or asking people, “here’s what I tried–what are you doing differently?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you can treat it as a skill with unlimited outcomes per-experience, rather than a forced repetition of past-self, you get a huge mental plasticity bonus. Once you’ve gotten to that point you can also find yourself building your own tech with fewer crippling concerns about future outcomes. It’s a great unlocking method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m skeptical about the validity of this comment, especially that last paragraph, it made me consider the concept of “looping.” Age regression is a well-documented case of “looping,” or coming back to what the mind and body know as comfortable. We make fun of freud all the time for pointing this out, but “looping” is an insidious trap in almost every areas of life. In the professional world, it manifests itself in a sort of “solidified seniority,” where veterans in the field are prone to missing things because they think they’ve seen it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, the only antidote to looping is acknowledgement. Without a clear awareness that you are regressing, you will never escape your arrested development. Alternatively, embrace the warmth that walking the treadmill of knowing holds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor J Perez III</name></author><category term="tech" /><summary type="html">The infamous Hacker News.

&lt;p&gt;Hate it when restaurants put you in the non-reservation side like an undesirable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways at the other fancy Mediterranean restaurant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might rant might not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about the portrait museum made me miss West Virginia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of it all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just spending time in shitty houses that were close to collapsing, drinking Hams and PBR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanging out at that one bar where I knew everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goin’ out on porches while my friends smoked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also remember frequently being afraid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of running into people I knew but didn’t like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were too many people back then I didn’t like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the list increased and increased while all the people I did like gradually left&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until all that was left was the people I didn’t want to see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think I miss recognizing people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now there’s only a handful of people here I’ve talked to more than once&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah I don’t really know where I was going with this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all I guess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is long and people are short&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember sitting together in that cramped room. Lights low, music softly playing from your computer. I wasn’t doing much of anything, I never did when you were around. Back when I was recovering from myself you were my entire world, though I’m sure the feeling wasn’t mutual. Just being there in your presence was enough, like sitting at a campfire or a warm stove. I’ll always find happiness in those memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trinity - Eartheater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some people you can look in the eye and only see plastic. Eyes that desperately want to be seen as genuine and caring, but only on the surface. I don’t known if it was the drugs or the loneliness, but something was truly broken in you. When we were alone your clamshell eyes barely cracked, I could never tell if you pitied me or wanted to be pitied. If there were any happiness found in those in those blistering eyes, I had no part in its unearthing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Late - Mixed Matches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I’ve been in a car alone with someone so long. Watching the expansive land of trees as you drove down the winding and relentless road. We talked about nothing in particular, at least nothing I can remember. Listening to music as we approached some unimportant destination. I think I knew back then, or at least had a feeling that it would be one of the last times we drove somewhere together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another Life - Amnesia Scanner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few people I’d rather not think of. You were one of them, existing at a time I hope to forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look Up Sharp - Carla dal Forno&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re in your early 20s it’s easy to be drawn to anyone that vaguely looks like they have their shit together. Especially someone that’s also exceptionally pretty. And then  time passes and you yourself vaguely get your shit together and you look back and wonder what you were even thinking at the time. Back then I valued things differently. The coldness for those around you may not mean much when you’re planning on simply leaving it all behind. Unfortunately, the way you treat people and they treat you sticks around.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor J Perez III</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><category term="music" /><summary type="html">A Good Fool - Michael Seyer I remember sitting together in that cramped room.

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, there are two distinct versions of myself separated by mind and body. As far as the mind is concerned we have Victor II, the current rendition that exists today, and then the Victor that looked into the mirror nine years ago: Victor I. Victor I, birthed of shame and anxiety, exists as a foil to the pride and perfectionism of Victor II. They represent themselves with fear and insecurity, dysmorphia and dysphoria. I’ve lost many years of my life to them, passed over many opportunities. My memories of living as &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt; are hazy unclear, and suppressed. In some ways, parts of &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt; remain inside of me. Upon looking into a mirror, I sometimes see the body of Victor II through the mind of &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt;, not recognizing my form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body of Victor II and &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt; is only separated by a severe class III jaw malocclusion– an underbite. &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt; is an anomaly and a deformity: their physical form slowly birthed a mind, quickly replacing the original. After years of existing as them, I was given a promise of freedom from the metaphorical chains of &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt;. All I needed to do was wear a set of literal chains, and undergo an allegedly transformative surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, the mind of &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt; was not killed by that surgery. By that point, they were barely alive, waiting to be dropped into the void. Their death and Victor II’s rebirth came when I decided that my pursuit of physical perfection was only leading me down a road of eternal patience. So I acted as if my flesh machine was in the form of my post-surgery self. It took many years of work to beat back the tumorous growth that was &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will come a time that I will not think of this distinction between Victors anymore, as the distinction will no longer exist. The mind of Victor II slowly becomes accustomed to their body again and thus will bring forth the demise of both. For now, I will just continue with this confusing existence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor J Perez III</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><summary type="html">This essay was published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found here In my mind, there are two distinct versions of myself separated by mind and body.

&lt;p&gt;Running from friends. Running from life. Running from family. No matter where I go, I can’t escape. Running from anxiety. Running from reality. Running from my future career. I’ve never been much of an athlete. My legs and my lungs are always in competition of what will give first. Running from my desires, because I felt like I was never worth them. Running from my needs, because other peoples’ were more important. Running is pointless and exhausting. Trying to justify why you’re running is almost as bad as the act of running itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I’ve been running my whole life. I’ve run figuratively from many things. Trying to avoid my problems, hoping they would go away. That’s how I ended up in Morgantown, after all. The first time I ran away from home was at the greatest place on earth; Disney World. I was never a very calm child. What I craved most was excitement and thrills. My parents just wanted to take a nice picture in front of the flowers. Pictures ran very antithetical to what I craved as a child. They made me mad, and I loudly rebelled whenever they were taken. “Where are the roller coasters? I wanna ride the roller coasters,” I can imagine myself demanding loudly. Finally, I snapped. We were at a photo studio for all the Disney characters waiting in line to take a picture with Goofy. Can you imagine waiting in line for something that wasn’t a roller coaster? I was having none of that nonsense. My mother said something very poorly thought out in the moment: “If you don’t like it, you can just leave.” So I did. Eight year old me left his family and started wandering around in Epcot, one of the few Disney World parks without roller coasters, to find a roller coaster. Yet, I was a determined little child, and relentless in my unknowingly pointless search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After around thirty minutes of limitless freedom, I saw a horri- fying sight: my aunt in a full speed sprint, high heels in hand. I tried running, but it was too late. She tackled me with full force, and started hitting and yelling at me for leaving and worrying my family. I don’t know what felt worse: the fact that all that running had been for nothing, or the high heels.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor J Perez III - I</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><summary type="html">This essay was originally published February 19th, 2018 and was re-published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found here Running from friends.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“ My mouth was sewn up ”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon waking up from my surgery, The first thing I noticed was how much I didn’t feel. Everything was numb and bloated. Uncomfortable, but not painful. The second thing I noticed was that I could not open my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt;. Strong elastic bands were attached to the surgical hooks on my braces. The only thing that could force my teeth apart was the strong convulsions that came with me vomiting blood all over myself while resting on my hospital bed. My lips were swollen as if my surgeon bundled in a botox injection with my double &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“ I have followed a path | That took sacrifices ”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the promised surgery. The one event that would change my life, solve all my problems. The surgery that five years of braces led up to. After being delayed three times, it was finally done. I always felt uncomfortable with the idea that one expensive medical procedure could fix all of your problems. Life is never that simple. Looking back though, it wasn’t just one medical procedure, it was years of sacrifice. Vacations abandoned for dental appointments. Internships forsaken for delayed surgery dates. So much pain. All leading up to eight of surgery, and three months of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My surgery was successful without any complications whatsoever. They didn’t even have to insert the dreaded catheter. All that was left was to heal. Two weeks in, my swelling went down enough to start moving my lips: I could speak. It took effort to make out the words, but I could communicate. Sometime after, a release show for the publication I worked hard on for a year took place. I was in a different state: another sacrifice I had to make for my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt;. Then, as I was about to sleep, I received a message from a friend about how much my work meant to him, and how he wished I was there to see the show. Over a hundred people showed up to that event, and I was not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“ Remove this hindrance ”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason double &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; surgery is considered a medical procedure and not a cosmetic procedure. The position of my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; prevented me from breathing easily through my nose, which meant I ended up breathing through my mouth most of the time. This led to an increase in cavities as well as gingivitis. Since my underbite was severe, I couldn’t eat with my front teeth, which meant the back teeth wore down faster than my others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of those medical issues concerned me. The blight of my underbite was the social anxieties I dealt with because of it. I was a sloppy eater, especially when it came to sandwiches, so I hated eating in front of other people. It was difficult for me to smile. As if I was permanently in a bad mood, I wore a frown wherever I went. When it came to talking, I spoke as sloppily as I ate. Words would be mumbled and jumbled together, and occasionally spit and drool would leave my mouth. Most of all, I felt ugly. I would look in the mirror and see a flesh shoe poking out from the bottom of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, I refused to form close relationships with anyone for any reason. I only wanted one thing; that life-changing surgery that was dangling in front of my eyes. My mother would often say: “Once you get your jaw fixed, you won’t be able to stop smiling!” I resent her for saying that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“ I was separated | From what I can do ”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nearly three weeks of recovering in Virginia, it was time to go back to Morgantown. I no longer had to eat with a syringe, and the swelling went down enough to make my speech more fluid. I was welcomed by my close friends, who understood me enough to make conversation. It was tiring, but I was able to live in relative normalcy for the next two weeks that my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; would be closed shut. Unfortunately, the liquid diet I was on eventually proved things difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking to and from class while barely ingesting a thousand calories a day meant I was faced with rapid weight loss. I would meet with close friends and talk for a while, but it left my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; sore and my body exhausted for the rest of the day. One week after moving in, I looked down at my belt and noticed that it was two positions tighter than I usually put it. My weight was dropping, and I couldn’t eat enough to make up for it. But this was just another sacrifice, one of the last few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“ Need to break up | Vicious habits ”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, I grew impatient. I had waited so long for the life-altering event, that it no longer seemed achievable. It had already been delayed once after all. So I resolved to remove the heartless parasite birthed from my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt;. To anyone that would listen, I would force myself to speak to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then my surgery was delayed again. My morale was crushed, and I began to assess my progress. I had surrounded myself with the first people willing to be my friend, however, I came to understand that not all friends are good. So I started over, and at the suggestion of someone I casually spoke to at a birthday party, I joined my college’s radio station. I started making real friends, ones I could depend on. The years passed, and eventually, I realized that the only time people recognized my underbite was when I stuck my finger in between the gap that formed when my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; was closed. When the third delay came, it didn’t bring as much despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“ With jaw fallen in | In fallen jaw ”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In five days from the time I’m writing this, the elastics holding my jaw together will be removed. I will be able to talk and breathe easier, but I will still be unable to eat solid food for two weeks more. Six weeks with a closed &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; is a small sacrifice for such a life-changing surgery. I do wonder though, why haven’t I felt self concious about my mouth being clamped shut? Why am I so calm? Did my surgery really cause this?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor J Perez III - II</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><summary type="html">This essay was published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found here “ My mouth was sewn up ” Upon waking up from my surgery, The first thing I noticed was how much I didn’t feel. Everything was numb and bloated. Uncomfortable, but not painful. The second thing I noticed was that I could not open my jaw. Strong elastic bands were attached to the surgical hooks on my braces. The only thing that could force my teeth apart was the strong convulsions that came with me vomiting blood all over myself while resting on my hospital bed. My lips were swollen as if my surgeon bundled in a botox injection with my double jaw surgery.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/writing/jaw.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/writing/jaw.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sisyphus</title><link href="/writing/nonfiction/music/2019/11/12/Sisyphus.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sisyphus" /><published>2019-11-12T09:50:47+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-12T09:50:47+00:00</updated><id>/writing/nonfiction/music/2019/11/12/Sisyphus</id><content type="html" xml:base="/writing/nonfiction/music/2019/11/12/Sisyphus.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay was published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://victorjperez.github.io/malocclusion&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Body Memory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember looking through the cold, empty room. Posters plastered the walls, and stickers lined the desks. I scanned through documents and browsed through files, looking for anything of interest on the events that transpired before my arrival. Amongst the mess, I found packets of macaroni and cheese, a pair of panties, and signs of a herculean effort to keep a college radio station running to the best of its ability. There was a constant effort to keep the dying art of radio alive, and eventually it all came crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paradisia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With most of the radio station’s key members gone, I eventually came to the realization that if I wanted to do something, I could just do it. I needn’t ask for permission, and provided that I wasn’t breaking any major rules, the absent Program Director wouldn’t say anything. So I spent most of my waking free time at the station. I would do homework there, sit in on people’s shifts, and go on air for eleven to fifteen hours a week. As a consequence of being there so much, I became close to many of the people there and encouraged them to spend their time there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Claimstaker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My efforts did not go unnoticed. At the beginning of my second semester, the interim general manager encouraged me to apply for the Program Director position, which unbeknownst to me, was combined with the Station Manager role. I applied, interviewed, and got the position over the person who I assumed was more qualified. That person convinced me my apprehensions and insecurities about my own qualifications were correct, and I stepped down and took a role as their assistant. That was a very &lt;em&gt;Victor I&lt;/em&gt; move of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tabula Rasa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, a certain person talked about reviving a historied station publication, you know the one. It seemed like a good enough idea; what better way to promote the station and show the university we existed? So we worked together to get things started. Eventually, I took it upon myself to work on the editing and layouts, as I had some experience with web development and there is some overlap in the skills necessary. I didn’t have much to go off of: the style guide binder mysteriously disappeared one day, leaving me with a single copy of the previous edition of the publication. All I could do was press on, and keep working as best I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Loss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came time to hire a new General Manager, I was there at the interview. When told there was one candidate, you can imagine how frustrated I was with the inevitability; the university had chosen, and the student staff was there to have the illusion of agency. Even so, I barraged the candidate with questions, trying to figure out exactly what the outlook of the future would be. When I asked why there was only one candidate, I came to my conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sue Me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never burned out harder than in my second semester as “Assistant Program Director.” Putting all of my free time into the station for so long was not healthy, and the one I was assisting was not doing their job. So I went to the recently hired General Manager and told them that I could not keep things up. And then I told them again: something needed to be done. After the third time, I sat down for an hour and told them I was at the end of what I could handle. The answer was the same as the first two: put up with things for now, and eventually, it will get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not take their advice. I was exhausted, at the end of my capacity. So I went to the Senate, the meeting of directors. At the end of that meeting, I announced that I felt as though I was doing more than I could keep up with, and if things did not get better in a month I would resign. The meeting was concluded, the Program Director wept, the boulder cracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Gate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew what I had done, and meant what it meant for my future. Things were better for a while, at least until it came to hire the new Program Director. When I found out that the current one was on the hiring board, I knew my time pushing that accursed boulder would be coming to an end. My hiring was blocked by one vote. When offered the role of assistant again, you can imagine what went through my head. At least I can be proud of the work I did when I had the chance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor J Perez III - II</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><category term="music" /><summary type="html">This essay was published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found here Body Memory I remember looking through the cold, empty room.

&lt;p&gt;To write creative nonfiction is to let yourself be vulnerable. You lay bare scars that are otherwise invisible, bring out painful memories that would rather be forgotten. Fashion, conversely, focuses on exclusivity and subtly. Fashion exists to hide and act while communicating silently, if at all. As such, finding creative nonfiction on the topic of fashion is nontrivial, and I spent a lot of time searching until I found myself on the homepage of &lt;em&gt;Vestoj.com&lt;/em&gt;. The design stood out to me from traditional fashion related websites: it had a simple, ad-free layout. There was a large focus on the text with sparse yet impactful photography, and every article had a diverse set of sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the article &lt;em&gt;Beggars And Choosers&lt;/em&gt; by Johannes Lenhard, I was hooked. Lenhard wasn’t just talking about clothes or runway shows. He wrote about poverty, and psychology, and how they could be viewed under the lens of fashion. It’s a rare thing to have a conversation about, and Vestoj housed a goldmine of articles just like it. I wasn’t seeing random people talk about dressing for dates, or the new streetwear “label” (five graphic t-shirts) they were creating. I was seeing the connection between fashion and everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’m explaining it in the most dramatic way possible, if only to mirror the feeling I was overcome with upon my discovery. As soon as the eighth issue, &lt;em&gt;On Authenticity&lt;/em&gt;, was released, I paid $30 for a copy and read it cover to cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, the essay &lt;em&gt;Acting As If&lt;/em&gt; by Michelle Millar Fisher jumped out at me. It details the link between wearing counterfeit clothing and feeling fake or inauthentic. Beyond that, those emotions influenced the actions of the wearers to be more dishonest, as well as perceiving others as more dishonest. That observation can be extended to individual thoughts and actions of a person; to believe you are something and act like it is to be that thing. This is the basis for cognitive behavioral therapy, which I eventually came to use a great deal to become free of my perceived self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same week, I hosted a “No Limits” radio station (A four hour segment of whatever audio content you could dream of), and read the article &lt;em&gt;The Making of a Star&lt;/em&gt; by Philippa Snow, another impactful essay on performativity, live on air while Aphex Twin played in the background. I wanted everyone to hear what these people had to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vestoj remains an important part of my life, enough to have a special place in this journal. Nearly everything I write and design, from print to website, is inspired by it. It’s fueled my interest in fashion and society, and even my own writing. I’m grateful to the London College of Fashion for funding it, and for Anja Aronowsky Cronberg for their founding and editing contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vestoj is a forum where academia, the museum world and the fashion industry can work together and with active communication. We write about the cultural phenomenon that is fashion in a manner that opens up for dialogue between theory and practice in order to raise awareness for fashion as a cultural phenomena and field of research and cultivate an even greater understanding for the discipline. Vestoj will exist outside of seasonally-based trends and news-focused articles. Instead we aim to encourage and champion the critical and independent voice within fashion as well as absolute creative freedom. In order to ensure that we remain free in thought and action Vestoj will have no advertising. Vestoj focuses solely on sartorial matters, bringing together academia and industry in a bid to combine academic theory, critical thinking and a bit of good old fashioned glamour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor J Perez III - II</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><category term="fashion" /><summary type="html">This essay was published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found here To write creative nonfiction is to let yourself be vulnerable.

&lt;p&gt;In a moment I was awake, stomach-churning and head drooping. Knowing what was coming, I frantically felt around for the phone remote in the half-lit intensive care unit. Then it came: blood. So much blood. Leaking through the gaps in my bound together teeth, filling the cold room with a vaguely metallic stench. I could do nothing but lurch and heave as it fell onto my hospital blanket. There was no chance to reach for the suction tube on my left; I gripped tightly to the rails of the hospital bed every time my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; convulsed and ejected blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, two nurses rushed in to assist me, using the suction tube to suck up the blood and vomit into the half-filled jar behind me. With moist eyes, I laid back, waiting for the morphine and anti-nausea medication to hit the bloodstream. The nurses changed my sheets, my mother came back from the bathroom, and I fell asleep out of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I looked at my face in the mirror after my double &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; surgery, I could only think of how big a mistake I made. My face blew up like a balloon, and underneath my &lt;em&gt;jaw&lt;/em&gt; was a sack of meat the size of an orange. Was this the new face I was promised after all these years? After all this pain? Of course not, but I was hopped up on too many drugs and barely enough sleep to make that mental connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a wheelchair came to pick me up and relocate me to a normal hospital room. After another day of taking pain and nausea meds and drinking soup stock to keep me alive, I was wheeled out of the hospital. I would go on to vomit again a week later, though this time I was left on my own to clear out everything from my mouth.
