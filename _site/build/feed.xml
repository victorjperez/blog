<p>Every person has points in their lives where a certain aspect of their being is born. Mine happened to be on an arbitrary Friday evening, staring out a window and sipping on a cup of coffee in a sizable but emptying cafe. It’s as if I suddenly started existing at that moment, eyes opening to a group of partygoers walking by the window. The one carrying a cardboard box suddenly tripped on the curb, spilling whipped cream canisters that loudly clanked on the concrete. “Not the whippits!” someone in the group screamed out as they scrambled to pick up as many as they could. Looking left, I locked eyes with the person sitting in the table next to mine and smiled; unknowingly meeting a close friend of a future friend.

<p>That moment beget many others, similar in nature. It was the first time I had truly gone out into the world on my own. I clung to that coffee shop, gradually increasing the frequency of my visits as I got more comfortable existing in public. After my classes for the day wrapped up I would join the long queue of regulars, staring at the various pastries and studying the varieties of drip coffees as the locals chatted. On weekends the cafe was so packed that I would sit at the coffee bar to study, saving the tables for proper groups. Eventually I started to converse with the baristas, often commenting on their music selection or the particularly rude customer that had just walked out. Putting names to the faces I had become familiar with as I read and worked on my college assignments.</p>

<p>The frequency of my visits increased sharply once I moved closer to the cafe. Instead of taking West Virginia University’s crumbling PRT system, all I had to do was walk across the Walnut Street Bridge. I would wake up in the morning, shower, then immediately head to the cafe and order an off-menu breakfast.</p>

<p>Opening up a tab that would last all day, I would leave for classes after breakfast and return in the afternoon. This was around the time where I became very involved with the radio station, and the amount of people I knew expanded far beyond what I ever expected it to. I remember coming in one day after doing my shift and finding the radio tuned in to 91.7FM, and one of the baristas I had became friends with rightfully ragging on my poor song selection. Outside of chatting up the baristas, friends would often stop by and sit at my table, and we’d mutually pretend to do coursework as we distracted each other. The impromptu nature of it all is something I treasured even at the time- there aren’t many places you can loiter at all day and randomly see four to five of your close friends.</p>

<p>A year later I had moved again, but was still in the same neighborhood as before. This was when I finally talked to Simone, an older regular who would arrive in the morning, sit at the coffee bar, and annoy the baristas like I did. Despite often seeing her in my periphery, we had never properly met until this point. But in a desire to avoid my mundane readings, I introduced myself.  Right off the bat she described each of her lovely cats that would bask in her sunroom while she tutored vocals and piano. Gradually we began to have lengthy conversations a few mornings a week where she would describe entire pieces of her past in detail. Like how drunken Morgantown couch burnings gradually became legitimate issue on her street. Most interesting though were the stories about her experiences in New York City as a young musician. The way she verbally painted a scene enthralled me, to the point where I would usually miss my first class of the day. Listening to her talk about beating up a mugger near her Manhattan apartment, or grabbing a bank teller by the collar and threatening him for the money she was owed. I forget the exact details of that story, but I’m certain there was for a perfectly legitimate reason for doing what she did.</p>

<p>The last regular I got to know was a PhD student confusingly studying fashion and computer science. We bonded over our mutual interest in textiles and garment construction, and they’d given me a fixed up sewing machine to sew masks for a drive.</p>

<p>It’s odd how many special moments like that came up from that old coffee shop. Even the small ones, like the rare cases a certain friend would drop by to discuss music and dental work. Or the times I invited someone to hang out just to make fun of him for nursing a book on mushrooms for several years. And of course I can’t leave out the time I made my date read and interpret Hegel’s The Phenomenology of Spirit to me, which shockingly was enough to interest her in a second date. I want to just write and remember all these people important to me, even if I’m the only one who cares. Just like how Simone would go on and on about her past in captivating detail. I hope that after all this time she still goes and sits on the bar stool closest to the register, loitering all morning and talking at the baristas while they attempt to take orders. Because of fellow inhabitants like her, my life became much fuller in the years I spent at the Blue Moose Cafe.</p>]]></content><author><name>Victor J Perez III</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This essay was published in Bletilla: Memories Preserved From Times Lost, which can be found here Every person has points in their lives where a certain aspect of their being is born.

<center><b>I</b></center>
<center><b>Remembrance</b></center>

<p>For a while I considered including the letter I wrote almost five years ago, back when we still lived together. The one about my relationship between the scent of cigarettes and memory. The strange comfort the invasive stench gave me as it reminded me of those close to me that smoked. The one where I described the first time we shared a single Djarum Black clove cigarillo between the two of us. And the night I smoked my last after becoming aware of your guilt for introducing me to the habit.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But that was five years ago, and there now exists two distinct eras of our lives together. The era of the radio station, where we met that night of the rookie party. Those countless times we loitered together in that empty space, throwing small parties on Friday nights. The era where I performed It Was a Good Day and read out essays from Vestoj live on air while you ate Rice-A-Roni in the back office. The days we would floor lay together during your regular rotation shifts.</p>

<p>And then there’s the era we exist in now, crossing that divide of time. Miraculously we are still in each other’s lives, despite how violently far away you live from the city.</p>

<p>Even still, I appreciate the time we get to spend together in the gaps between the various assignments you’re shipped off to. The fact that we’ve remained in each others orbits for so long is both unsurprising and appreciated. You will always be the first in my thoughts when I smell a freshly lit cigarette.</p>

<center><b>II</b></center>
<center><b>Deliverance</b></center>

<p>I often think about the times we would sit together in that crowded room. Lit with soft string lights and a weak old lamp, music softly playing from your computer as you sorted through CDs for regular rotation. I never did much of anything when you were around, preferring to spin around in my chair as we would talk. Back when we met for the second time, I was shocked a person from my past and his younger brother had followed me from hundreds of miles away. But that coincidence blossomed into reconciliation: a destruction of the wall I once had. Though I’m sure our meeting meant much more to me than it did for you, I never once minded. Just being there in your presence was enough, like sitting by a campfire. I’ll always find happiness in those private memories.</p>

<center><b>III</b></center>
<center><b>Repentance</b></center>

<p>You may be asking yourself why I’ve given you this lengthy novel, fully knowing that you aren’t that kind of reader that would have any interest in it. Trust that I haven’t deluded myself into thinking you’ll get through <em>The Brothers Karmazov</em> in its entirety. It’s slow to start and is filled to the brim with historical and philosophical discussions on the state of 19th century Russia. In the midst of it all, a prominent struggle between faith and atheism is present in its plot. While the Russian Orthodox church has many differences from modern day American Christianity, the underlying biblical context makes it easily understandable to your or I.</p>

<p>There’s two sections in particular that I recommend you read, if nothing else. They relate to three of the many major characters in the story, so I’ll give you a little context on them. First is Ivan Karamazov, who is an intellectual and atheist, holding the conviction that “If there is no God, everything is lawful.” He contrasts greatly with one of his three brothers, Alexei; a young monk at the local monastery and a devout follower of its elder, Father Zosima. The first section I recommend you read is <em>The Grand Inquisitor</em>; a poem written by Ivan about the hypothetical second coming of Christ during the Spanish Inquisition. The second is the set of chapters that follow the life of a dying Father Zosima, and the path he took to become a lauded man of god. Not only are these two pieces masterworks of literature, but they intentionally have contrasting narratives to highlight the complexity of the Russian Orthodox church and by extension Christianity as a whole. It is because of this complexity that I chose to live my life outside of the influence of the religious construct you raised me in, and instead live my way in that is Christlike. Treating those around me with compassion and understanding, though inevitably having my own set of sins like any other man. While its an imperfect philosophy, it’s one that fits the most for me at the stage I am in life. I hope you’ll read these selected parts and understand more the internal conflict I have with faith.</p>

<center><b>IV</b></center>
<center><b>Dependence</b></center>

<p>There are some people you can look in their eyes and only see plastic. Eyes that desperately want to be seen as genuine and caring, but only on the surface. When we were alone your clamshell eyes never cracked- I couldn’t tell if you pitied me or wanted to be pitied. If there were any happiness found in those in that blistering gaze, I had no part in its unearthing.</p>

<p>Yet, I kept coming back to you. Because even your cold warmth was enough in a time I was surrounded my emptiness. It was because of your warmth that when I wordlessly left your life, regret consumed me. You never asked where I’d gone, but I should still have said goodbye.</p>

<center><b>V</b></center>
<center><b>Temperance</b></center>

<p>I find it really interesting how our friendship in particular has endured this long. Over this many years and changes of circumstance. Despite us only ever meeting face to face twice while you passed through DC on your travels. I was expecting it to all come crumbling down the day I revealed myself to not be a 40 year old man and instead just a similarly aged weirdo. To me, it was more shocking that you didn’t realize, though I’m sure you had some level of awareness I was lying.</p>

<p>I often think of how different my life would be if we never met playing that funny block game with PhD students from Durham University. I would have missed out on the insane and interesting details of your life in Bushwick; like the roommate currently running a python breeding operation in your basement, or the time you accidentally brought up Puerto Rican independence to a bunch of Puerto Ricans. I probably should have warned you about that last one. Some of the most interesting conversations I’ve had took place in our messages, without a single word spoken aloud. As we’ve moved through the different phases of life and the frequency of our communication has waxed and waned, we’ve never truly left each other behind. I don’t even know if we ever could at this point.</p>

The amount of people in that town I told about my departure was in the single digits, and on the day of the move only one thought was present: “I cannot be seen.” That attitude defined my return from Washington, DC. I flew into town on an eight person plane the day of the event, and left on that same plane early the next morning. No time was left for wandering the streets of my Alma mater, or loitering in the same coffee shops I used to. Similar to my departure, very few knew of my return, only those at the event itself- a bridal shower and going away party for a close friend of mine. 
 <!--more-->
It made sense that the theme of said party was “afternoon tea,” as Madeleine was leaving for grad school in England. Looking around the small West Virginian winery, I eyed up the tiny sandwiches and cakes prepared by her parents. Remembering the Friday nights I spent waiting tables at their restaurant and drinking on the stoop. I had never been to this particular venue before, and it was distant from my former life- though the ever-present mountains remained a familiar landmark. While waiting for the event to formally start, I was particularly exhausted from a party in my “new life” from the night before. That and the colonial setting made me feel slightly delirious given that I had the darkest skin at the venue, a common occurrence in West Virginia. Surrounding me were distant family members who treated the event more as a bridal shower and less like a going away party.</p>

<p>Eventually our friends stumbled into the patio, similarly experiencing shades of delirium from the setting and attendees. Coming down from Pittsburgh was not a frequent experience for them, though they had old roots in this decaying state. For those that hadn’t visited me in Washington, it had been over a year since seeing or even speaking to them. When most people think of seeing old friends, they think of a celebratory and joyous moment, a return to the good old times. But our reality was different- too much time had passed. Some of us had changed more than others, and our lives were no longer intertwined as they once were. Awkward tensions arose from unfinished business, and the sea of unfamiliar faces gave a cold edge.</p>

<p>The “bridal shower” portion of the party resolved fairly quickly, and after some light chatting over tea and tiny sandwiches Madeleine’s extended family began spilling out. The venue was left to us “friends of the bridal party,” and swiftly we got to work doing one of the few things there really is to do in West Virginia; drinking and chain-smoking. The heat was particularly nasty that day, and all we really had the energy to do was laze around and reminisce. Thinking back, I can’t really remember more than a handful of details from the conversations we had. We explained the details of our boring new lives, and plans for our future apart. Most fascinating was the jar of teeth a friend in dental school had received from a mentor. Some of the groom’s friends started playing acoustic guitar in the background of our conversations, bringing forth even more distant memories. After a few hours, we had exhausted our conversational material. All that was left was to say our goodbyes, and prepare for my flight the next morning.</p>

<p>That night I stayed at Madeleine’s family home, and was driven there by her younger brother. Driving through the town I once called home was the only part of the trip I can vividly remember. Late at night browsing through past meeting places, school buildings, homes of former lovers. I thought of all the people I would be leaving behind and those I unfairly decided not to tell of my secret return. If they found out I was here, would they hate me even more than I think they do? As we drove through the main street of town, I noted how many business had been shuttered. So many places I thought were important were gone, replaced by “for lease” signs and whatever a cereal bar is. College towns are constantly in a state of change, but I wondered if this abyss of a town was freshly decaying or had always been that way. The next morning, I said goodbye to Madeleine’s mother and flew back home.</p>]]></content><author><name>Victor J Perez III</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around one year ago I left Morgantown, West Virginia.

<p>The last eight months of my life have been cursed with <em>Anna Karenina</em>. Nearly 1,000 pages of languishing Russian aristocratic life, printed in the smallest legible text possible. Like many classical Russian works, it is filled with romantically mundane portraits of everyday life that often double as thinly veiled metaphors. Most abundantly, there is a concentration of raw misery conveyed in the beautifully written prose. As if Leo Tolstoy is deeply unsatisfied with the society constructed around him, but cannot help but express this in his own prideful way. In that sense he’s a selfish writer, penning his angry critique into chapters that were then disseminated into the general public. Expressing emotions that should best be kept to oneself or those close.
 <!--more--></p>

<p>In the year 2020 I published nothing I wrote. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that I wrote very little at all. Outside of that domineering virus spreading around the world at the time, a realization had slowly poisoned my conscious: the idea that in order to write about ones life and memories, one must have a handful of narcissistic traits. While not everything I write is “experience writing” centered purely on me, a great deal of it is. Inside of a quote that I have much adoration for, Franz Lebowitz states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Your life story would not make a good book. Do not even try.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems as though that sentence has been engraved inside of my psyche. Rather than pour my experiences outward to my adoring and ghostly audience, I decided to close the floodgates, and take them inward.</p>

<p>Fyodor Dovstoyevsky’s seminal novella <em>Notes From Underground</em> is in essence, a story of a bitter man that has a compulsion to rant. Self-nicknamed “the underground man,” the narrator starts off with a philosophical tirade on human suffering and misery. It is a carefully distilled rant, bordering on psychotic, covering human suffering and morals. Deeply unpleasant to read, you will quickly come to realize that the “underground man” is simply a mouthpiece for Dovstoyevsky disdain for parts of Russian society. These overt criticisms are often mirrored in <em>Anna Karenina</em>, though in a much subtler fashion.</p>

<p>The second part of <em>Notes from Underground</em>, titled <em>Apropos of the Wet Snow</em>, is a handful of anecdotal stories by “the underground man.” A narration of his empty, retired life in Russia. As if he had taken the the ideology in the first part and lived it to its fullest, he goes around wallowing in his misery, spreading it in the form of external monologues (rants). One chapter hit me in particular: after visiting a prostitute, the underground man wakes up and decides that now is a good time to lay on the vilest rant possible to the poor, green woman. He goes into excruciating detail about the ways society and life will fail her, how misery or consumption will take her, emphasizing that she will in fact die some day. In all this truly depressing barrage of words, Dostoyevsky, or the underground man encapsulates the essence of the rant:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn’t calculate his happiness…</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like <em>Notes From Underground</em>, Many of Dostoyevsky’s works contain chapter-long rants from his most desperate characters. But by virtue of the medium, they naturally lack the intimacy that rants can have. It feels good to rant- like a pressure valve of thoughts being released from one’s mind. The danger of course, is that not everyone wants or is equipped to handle the scalding steam that you may put out.</p>

<p>Therefore, rants must be reserved for close friends and lovers that can understand or empathize with your struggle, especially if you’re talking about some sensitive or upsetting subject matter. To rant to someone is to have the utmost trust in them, giving them details about your life you would never want revealed to another soul.</p>

<p>Many realizations come from late night rants of misery, written in text. The little lies you tell yourself to keep things going tend to mysteriously be missing when you write faster than you can think. After all, ranting in this way is writing the subconscious. Provided your mind is free from distraction and you never think about the structure of your sentences and words, it can bring fourth the inner self in a way not possible verbally. Most importantly, one must never forget that a rant is purely for ones self. There should be no worry that you are being too self-absorbed or narcissistic. If you truly are, it will be revealed on its own. The only embarrassment you should feel in the context of a rant is when you re-read it days later and realize that things were not as bad as you thought they were at the time.</p>

<p>I’m actually borrowing this old, crumbling copy of <em>Anna Karenina</em>. It was one of around seven to eight copies that a woman I went on a single date with owned. According to her, it was the best translation out of them all. More realistically it was likely the one she was willing to part with considering she still hadn’t read a single copy. We haven’t spoken to each other since then, and I haven’t decided if I want to give it back after I’m done. Maybe my insufferable rant about <em>Notes From Underground</em> scared her off.</p>

It’s rss-like tech news aggregation format and community of software engineers, project managers, and other tech-adjacent commenters offers an experience lacking in most social media platforms. In some cases your browsing experience can leave you with some rare insight from a hardened industry veteran. More often than not, you end up reading some of the most insane takes from the dumbest smart people you could ever imagine. <!--more-->Just off the cuff, one article about math led to an argument about the semantics of zen spirituality and peeling potatoes. Honestly it’s just stunning to read what incredible <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29999372">insights</a> our best and brightest knowledge workers have on life:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p><em>If you are peeling the potatoes and have a bit of whole-hearted potato peeling and then immediately go off “wow, I was really focused there, what Zen potato peeling!” for a minute, well, those thoughts are not Zen spirituality. It’s a common problem with reading or listening to stories about whole-hearted activity - one fills up with “Zen thoughts” for a while.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this person correct? It doesn’t matter. Every article posted to Hacker News is filled with banal arguments with varying levels of humor.</p>

<p>One topic that is posted on Hacker News weekly is <em>“Zettelkasten”</em> a note taking technique where notes relate and link to each other. I can’t help mentioning one of the more psychotic systems I found in one of these <a href="https://lmy.medium.com/a-tour-to-my-zettelkasten-notes-dc26a75e5257">posts</a>: a template for a “Personal CRM” where you list out every contact you know, their relations, status, last contact, and what the last contact contained. Whoever wrote this article should really reconsider what they’re trying to accomplish here. It cannot be healthy to compartmentalize relationships like this. People are not data points on a spreadsheet to keep track of.</p>

<p>There was one positive thing out of all these note taking articles. Not the note taking system itself, but a comment that really made me reflect on many areas of my life. It was a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23387255">reply</a> to a criticism behind the intent of the system itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>People love doing things that feel like work, but aren’t.</em></p>

  <p><em>I’m terrified of picking up new systems like this without having a purpose. I could spend hours building out a graph, admiring all of MY knowledge, but not really have any intended use for it other than telling others about it and how I’m going to use it someday.</em></p>

<p>The reply was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>You’re in a perceptive loop concerning this particular object (systems like this) then. You see future-self behaving as past-self did.</em></p>

  <p><em>You can keep doing that, looping. People who are natural contingency planners do this all the time–they map their past onto future-self. Flexing this muscle because it’s strongest.</em></p>

  <p><em>However this is also a good way of preventing yourself from re-exploring new objects through a different lens.</em></p>

  <p><em>Or asking people, “here’s what I tried–what are you doing differently?”</em></p>

  <p><em>If you can treat it as a skill with unlimited outcomes per-experience, rather than a forced repetition of past-self, you get a huge mental plasticity bonus. Once you’ve gotten to that point you can also find yourself building your own tech with fewer crippling concerns about future outcomes. It’s a great unlocking method.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I’m skeptical about the validity of this comment, especially that last paragraph, it made me consider the concept of “looping.” Age regression is a well-documented case of “looping,” or coming back to what the mind and body know as comfortable. We make fun of freud all the time for pointing this out, but “looping” is an insidious trap in almost every areas of life. In the professional world, it manifests itself in a sort of “solidified seniority,” where veterans in the field are prone to missing things because they think they’ve seen it all.</p>

<p>In my eyes, the only antidote to looping is acknowledgement. Without a clear awareness that you are regressing, you will never escape your arrested development. Alternatively, embrace the warmth that walking the treadmill of knowing holds.</p>]]></content><author><name>Victor J Perez III</name></author><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The infamous Hacker News.

<p>The simplicity of it all</p>

<p>Just spending time in shitty houses that were close to collapsing, drinking Hams and PBR</p>

<p>Hanging out at that one bar where I knew everyone</p>

<p>Goin’ out on porches while my friends smoked</p>

<p>But I also remember frequently being afraid</p>

<p>Of running into people I knew but didn’t like</p>

<p>There were too many people back then I didn’t like</p>

<p>And the list increased and increased while all the people I did like gradually left</p>

<p>Until all that was left was the people I didn’t want to see</p>

<p>I remember sitting together in that cramped room. Lights low, music softly playing from your computer. I wasn’t doing much of anything, I never did when you were around. Back when I was recovering from myself you were my entire world, though I’m sure the feeling wasn’t mutual. Just being there in your presence was enough, like sitting at a campfire or a warm stove. I’ll always find happiness in those memories.</p>

<p><em>Trinity - Eartheater</em></p>

<p>There are some people you can look in the eye and only see plastic. Eyes that desperately want to be seen as genuine and caring, but only on the surface. I don’t known if it was the drugs or the loneliness, but something was truly broken in you. When we were alone your clamshell eyes barely cracked, I could never tell if you pitied me or wanted to be pitied. If there were any happiness found in those in those blistering eyes, I had no part in its unearthing.</p>

<p><em>Late - Mixed Matches</em></p>

<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve been in a car alone with someone so long. Watching the expansive land of trees as you drove down the winding and relentless road. We talked about nothing in particular, at least nothing I can remember. Listening to music as we approached some unimportant destination. I think I knew back then, or at least had a feeling that it would be one of the last times we drove somewhere together.</p>

<p><em>Look Up Sharp - Carla dal Forno</em></p>

<p>When you’re in your early 20s it’s easy to be drawn to anyone that vaguely looks like they have their shit together. Especially someone that’s also exceptionally pretty. And then  time passes and you yourself vaguely get your shit together and you look back and wonder what you were even thinking at the time. Back then I valued things differently. The coldness for those around you may not mean much when you’re planning on simply leaving it all behind. Unfortunately, the way you treat people and they treat you sticks around.</p>]]></content><author><name>Victor J Perez III</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><category term="music" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Good Fool - Michael Seyer I remember sitting together in that cramped room.

<p>In my mind, there are two distinct versions of myself separated by mind and body. As far as the mind is concerned we have Victor II, the current rendition that exists today, and then the Victor that looked into the mirror nine years ago: Victor I. Victor I, birthed of shame and anxiety, exists as a foil to the pride and perfectionism of Victor II. They represent themselves with fear and insecurity, dysmorphia and dysphoria. I’ve lost many years of my life to them, passed over many opportunities. My memories of living as <em>Victor I</em> are hazy unclear, and suppressed. In some ways, parts of <em>Victor I</em> remain inside of me. Upon looking into a mirror, I sometimes see the body of Victor II through the mind of <em>Victor I</em>, not recognizing my form.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The body of Victor II and <em>Victor I</em> is only separated by a severe class III jaw malocclusion– an underbite. <em>Victor I</em> is an anomaly and a deformity: their physical form slowly birthed a mind, quickly replacing the original. After years of existing as them, I was given a promise of freedom from the metaphorical chains of <em>Victor I</em>. All I needed to do was wear a set of literal chains, and undergo an allegedly transformative surgery.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, the mind of <em>Victor I</em> was not killed by that surgery. By that point, they were barely alive, waiting to be dropped into the void. Their death and Victor II’s rebirth came when I decided that my pursuit of physical perfection was only leading me down a road of eternal patience. So I acted as if my flesh machine was in the form of my post-surgery self. It took many years of work to beat back the tumorous growth that was <em>Victor I</em>.</p>

<p>There will come a time that I will not think of this distinction between Victors anymore, as the distinction will no longer exist. The mind of Victor II slowly becomes accustomed to their body again and thus will bring forth the demise of both. For now, I will just continue with this confusing existence.</p>]]></content><author><name>Victor J Perez III</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This essay was published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found here In my mind, there are two distinct versions of myself separated by mind and body.

<p>Running from friends. Running from life. Running from family. No matter where I go, I can’t escape. Running from anxiety. Running from reality. Running from my future career. I’ve never been much of an athlete. My legs and my lungs are always in competition of what will give first. Running from my desires, because I felt like I was never worth them. Running from my needs, because other peoples’ were more important. Running is pointless and exhausting. Trying to justify why you’re running is almost as bad as the act of running itself.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I feel like I’ve been running my whole life. I’ve run figuratively from many things. Trying to avoid my problems, hoping they would go away. That’s how I ended up in Morgantown, after all. The first time I ran away from home was at the greatest place on earth; Disney World. I was never a very calm child. What I craved most was excitement and thrills. My parents just wanted to take a nice picture in front of the flowers. Pictures ran very antithetical to what I craved as a child. They made me mad, and I loudly rebelled whenever they were taken. “Where are the roller coasters? I wanna ride the roller coasters,” I can imagine myself demanding loudly. Finally, I snapped. We were at a photo studio for all the Disney characters waiting in line to take a picture with Goofy. Can you imagine waiting in line for something that wasn’t a roller coaster? I was having none of that nonsense. My mother said something very poorly thought out in the moment: “If you don’t like it, you can just leave.” So I did. Eight year old me left his family and started wandering around in Epcot, one of the few Disney World parks without roller coasters, to find a roller coaster. Yet, I was a determined little child, and relentless in my unknowingly pointless search.</p>

<p>After around thirty minutes of limitless freedom, I saw a horri- fying sight: my aunt in a full speed sprint, high heels in hand. I tried running, but it was too late. She tackled me with full force, and started hitting and yelling at me for leaving and worrying my family. I don’t know what felt worse: the fact that all that running had been for nothing, or the high heels.</p>]]></content><author><name>Victor J Perez III - I</name></author><category term="nonfiction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This essay was originally published February 19th, 2018 and was re-published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found here Running from friends.
