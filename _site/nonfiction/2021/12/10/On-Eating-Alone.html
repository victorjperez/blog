    <p><em>Today at 7:17 PM</em></p>

<p>Hate it when restaurants put you in the non-reservation side like an undesirable</p>

<p>Anyways at the other fancy Mediterranean restaurant</p>

<p>Might rant might not</p>

<p><!--more--></p>

<p>Something about the portrait museum made me miss West Virginia</p>

<p>The simplicity of it all</p>

<p>Just spending time in shitty houses that were close to collapsing, drinking Hams and PBR</p>

<p>Hanging out at that one bar where I knew everyone</p>

<p>Goin’ out on porches while my friends smoked</p>

<p>But I also remember frequently being afraid</p>

<p>Of running into people I knew but didn’t like</p>

<p>There were too many people back then I didn’t like</p>

<p>And the list increased and increased while all the people I did like gradually left</p>

<p>Until all that was left was the people I didn’t want to see</p>

<p>But I think I miss recognizing people</p>

<p>Right now there’s only a handful of people here I’ve talked to more than once</p>

<p>Yeah I don’t really know where I was going with this</p>

<p>That’s all I guess</p>

<p>Life is long and people are short</p>

<p><em>Today at 7:31 PM</em></p>

<p>Does everyone else in this goddamn restaurant have a reservation??</p>

<p>Every person has points in their lives where a certain aspect of their being is born. Mine happened to be on an arbitrary Friday evening, staring out a window and sipping on a cup of coffee in a sizable but emptying cafe. It’s as if I suddenly started existing at that moment, eyes opening to a group of partygoers walking by the window. The one carrying a cardboard box suddenly tripped on the curb, spilling whipped cream canisters that loudly clanked on the concrete. “Not the whippits!” someone in the group screamed out as they scrambled to pick up as many as they could. Looking left, I locked eyes with the person sitting in the table next to mine and smiled; unknowingly meeting a close friend of a future friend.</p>

<p>For a while I considered including the letter I wrote almost five years ago, back when we still lived together. The one about my relationship between the scent of cigarettes and memory. The strange comfort the invasive stench gave me as it reminded me of those close to me that smoked. The one where I described the first time we shared a single Djarum Black clove cigarillo between the two of us. And the night I smoked my last after becoming aware of your guilt for introducing me to the habit.</p>

<p>The last eight months of my life have been cursed with <em>Anna Karenina</em>. Nearly 1,000 pages of languishing Russian aristocratic life, printed in the smallest legible text possible. Like many classical Russian works, it is filled with romantically mundane portraits of everyday life that often double as thinly veiled metaphors. Most abundantly, there is a concentration of raw misery conveyed in the beautifully written prose. As if Leo Tolstoy is deeply unsatisfied with the society constructed around him, but cannot help but express this in his own prideful way. In that sense he’s a selfish writer, penning his angry critique into chapters that were then disseminated into the general public. Expressing emotions that should best be kept to oneself or those close.</p>
