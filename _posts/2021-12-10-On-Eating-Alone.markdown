Hate it when restaurants put you in the non-reservation side like an undesirable

Anyways at the other fancy Mediterranean restaurant

Might rant might not

Something about the portrait museum made me miss West Virginia

The simplicity of it all

Just spending time in shitty houses that were close to collapsing, drinking Hams and PBR

Hanging out at that one bar where I knew everyone

Goin' out on porches while my friends smoked

But I also remember frequently being afraid 

Of running into people I knew but didn’t like

There were too many people back then I didn’t like

And the list increased and increased while all the people I did like gradually left

Until all that was left was the people I didn’t want to see

But I think I miss recognizing people

Right now there’s only a handful of people here I’ve talked to more than once

Yeah I don’t really know where I was going with this

That’s all I guess

Life is long and people are short

Does everyone else in this goddamn restaurant have a reservation??
