I was going to go on a whole spiel about this quote and how lifechanging/etc it was but I feel like that misses the point so I'll leave it here so I won't forget it:

"Very few people possess true artistic ability. It is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to irritate the situation by making an effort. If you have a burning, restless urge to write or paint, simply eat something sweet and the feeling will pass. Your life story would not make a good book. Do not even try."
