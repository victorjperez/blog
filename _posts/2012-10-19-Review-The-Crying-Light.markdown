An extraordinarily emotional and classical album, The Crying Light by Antony & The Johnsons seems to recreate several feelings in one fell swoop.

My opinions:
I can respect  Antony & The Johnsons. For the first time, I find an album that has moved me such as this one. With most records that strive for deep feelings, they ultimately fail and sound undeniably cheesy. Nothing I could ever say could convey what listening to this album actually feels like. However, it’s not for every time or person. With most albums that I favor, I’m almost always in the mood to listen to them. With The Crying Light, I find that more often than not, I don’t want to listen to it. Don’t take this the wrong way, The Crying Light is pretty much the most perfect and well-rounded album I have ever listened to, but I rate my albums on how much replay value it has/ How much it’s worth of your money. In most cases, a good album generally has a good replay value, and a bad one has little to none. This is just one of those exceptions.

**6/10**
