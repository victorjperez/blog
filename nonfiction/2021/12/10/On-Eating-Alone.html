    <p><em>Today at 7:17 PM</em></p>

<p>Hate it when restaurants put you in the non-reservation side like an undesirable</p>

<p>Anyways at the other fancy Mediterranean restaurant</p>

<p>Might rant might not</p>

<p><!--more--></p>

<p>Something about the portrait museum made me miss West Virginia</p>

<p>The simplicity of it all</p>

<p>Just spending time in shitty houses that were close to collapsing, drinking Hams and PBR</p>

<p>Hanging out at that one bar where I knew everyone</p>

<p>Goin’ out on porches while my friends smoked</p>

<p>But I also remember frequently being afraid</p>

<p>Of running into people I knew but didn’t like</p>

<p>There were too many people back then I didn’t like</p>

<p>And the list increased and increased while all the people I did like gradually left</p>

<p>Until all that was left was the people I didn’t want to see</p>

<p>But I think I miss recognizing people</p>

<p>Right now there’s only a handful of people here I’ve talked to more than once</p>

<p>Yeah I don’t really know where I was going with this</p>

<p>That’s all I guess</p>

<p>Life is long and people are short</p>

<p><em>Today at 7:31 PM</em></p>

<p>Does everyone else in this goddamn restaurant have a reservation??</p>

<p><p>The last six months of my life have been filled with <em>Anna Karenina</em>. Nearly 1,000 pages of languishing Russian aristocratic life, printed in the smallest letters possible that could still be interpreted. Like many classical Russian works, it is filled with romantically mundane portraits of everyday life that often double as thinly veiled metaphors. Most abundantly, there is a concentration of raw misery conveyed in the beautifully written prose. As if Leo Tolstoy is deeply unsatisfied with the society he has been brought up in, but cannot help but express this in his own prideful way. In that sense he’s a selfish writer, penning his angry critique into chapters that were then disseminated into the general public. Expressing emotions that should best be kept to oneself or those close.</p>

<p><p>Around one year ago I left Morgantown, West Virginia. The amount of people in that town I told about my departure was in the single digits, and on the day of the move only one thought was present: “I cannot be seen.” That attitude defined my return from Washington, DC. I flew into town on an eight person plane the day of the event, and left on that same plane early the next morning. No time was left for wandering the streets of my Alma mater, or loitering in the same coffee shops I used to. Similar to my departure, very few knew of my return, only those at the event itself- a bridal shower and going away party for a close friend of mine.</p>

<p><p><em>A Good Fool - Michael Seyer</em></p>

<p>I remember sitting together in that cramped room. Lights low, music softly playing from your computer. I wasn’t doing much of anything, I never did when you were around. Back when I was recovering from myself you were my entire world, though I’m sure the feeling wasn’t mutual. Just being there in your presence was enough, like sitting at a campfire or a warm stove. I’ll always find happiness in those memories.</p>
