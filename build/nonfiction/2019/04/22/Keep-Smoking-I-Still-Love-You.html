    <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve found the smell of cigarettes comforting. In the far reaches of my memory are scenes of my grandfather’s kitchen, where I sat waiting for him while he was out on the porch. The door opens as someone enters the house, and I catch the ethereal scent of cigarette smoke as the door quickly closes behind them. I don’t have a particularly close connection to my grandfather, or even his house for that matter. Nonetheless, any time I notice the smell, it brings a wave of comfort and pleasant feelings.</p>

<p>Even after four years, I remain surprised at the amount of people who smoke cigarettes in this town. Back at home, it was a rarity to see someone smoke unless you went into the city. I’ve lost count of the people I know in Morgantown who smoke.</p>

<p>The amount of cigarettes I’ve smoked remains in the single digits, and will probably stay that way for the rest of my lifetime. Kate was the first person I smoked with. During parties we would occasionally both become overwhelmed, and relax on the porch together. For whatever reason, she only smokes when she drinks, and we were able to enjoy the quiet company of each other and the cool midnight air. I adore thinking of those moments, each tied together by the memory of her lit cigarette. Eventually one day the siren smell of her clove cigarette hit me, and I innocently requested a puff. The flavor of clove jumped out on me, and lingered on my lips as it passed it to hers. I can’t recall anything else about that day: just her and I, passing that single black cigarette back and forth.</p>

<p>I’ve grown to find Morgantown comforting. Previously the aggressiveness of this town frightened me, but those around me have helped me enjoy my presence here. There are times I think about my fear of leaving and wonder if I’ve been conditioned to love this town.</p>

<p>The last time I smoked was with Kate. We were passing each other a clove cigarette, from a pack I bought for her. There was a sense of guilt radiating from her about the passing on of her habit. After a short while of her mincing words, I decided to stop before it truly did become a habit. That day is burned into my memory: she was wearing a long dress with flowers, and we sat together on the steps behind the college radio station. I didn’t sleep well that night, the pain of hurting each other kept me awake. I still miss the intimacy of sharing cigarettes with her on porches.</p>

<p>If I left Morgantown, I would be leaving Kate behind. My head grows light and my eyes moisten when I think about this. She’s been very upfront about wanting me to leave for a better life, but I can feel the hesitation. Would it be that bad to stay?</p>

<p>In my mind, there are two distinct versions of myself separated by mind and body. As far as the mind is concerned we have Victor II, the current rendition that exists today, and then the Victor that looked into the mirror nine years ago: Victor I. Victor I, birthed of shame and anxiety, exists as a foil to the pride and perfectionism of Victor II. They represent themselves with fear and insecurity, dysmorphia and dysphoria. I’ve lost many years of my life to them, passed over many opportunities. My memories of living as <em>Victor I</em> are hazy unclear, and suppressed. In some ways, parts of <em>Victor I</em> remain inside of me. Upon looking into a mirror, I sometimes see the body of Victor II through the mind of <em>Victor I</em>, not recognizing my form.</p>

<p>Running from friends. Running from life. Running from family. No matter where I go, I can’t escape. Running from anxiety. Running from reality. Running from my future career. I’ve never been much of an athlete. My legs and my lungs are always in competition of what will give first. Running from my desires, because I felt like I was never worth them. Running from my needs, because other peoples’ were more important. Running is pointless and exhausting. Trying to justify why you’re running is almost as bad as the act of running itself.</p>

<center><b><i>“ My mouth was sewn up ”</i></b></center>

<p>Upon waking up from my surgery, The first thing I noticed was how much I didn’t feel. Everything was numb and bloated. Uncomfortable, but not painful. The second thing I noticed was that I could not open my <em>jaw</em>. Strong elastic bands were attached to the surgical hooks on my braces. The only thing that could force my teeth apart was the strong convulsions that came with me vomiting blood all over myself while resting on my hospital bed. My lips were swollen as if my surgeon bundled in a botox injection with my double <em>jaw</em> surgery.</p>
