    <p><em>This essay was published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found <a href="https://victorjperez.github.io/malocclusion">here</a></em></p>

<p>In a moment I was awake, stomach-churning and head drooping. Knowing what was coming, I frantically felt around for the phone remote in the half-lit intensive care unit. Then it came: blood. So much blood. Leaking through the gaps in my bound together teeth, filling the cold room with a vaguely metallic stench. I could do nothing but lurch and heave as it fell onto my hospital blanket. There was no chance to reach for the suction tube on my left; I gripped tightly to the rails of the hospital bed every time my <em>jaw</em> convulsed and ejected blood.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Finally, two nurses rushed in to assist me, using the suction tube to suck up the blood and vomit into the half-filled jar behind me. With moist eyes, I laid back, waiting for the morphine and anti-nausea medication to hit the bloodstream. The nurses changed my sheets, my mother came back from the bathroom, and I fell asleep out of exhaustion.</p>

<p>The first time I looked at my face in the mirror after my double <em>jaw</em> surgery, I could only think of how big a mistake I made. My face blew up like a balloon, and underneath my <em>jaw</em> was a sack of meat the size of an orange. Was this the new face I was promised after all these years? After all this pain? Of course not, but I was hopped up on too many drugs and barely enough sleep to make that mental connection.</p>

<p>Eventually, a wheelchair came to pick me up and relocate me to a normal hospital room. After another day of taking pain and nausea meds and drinking soup stock to keep me alive, I was wheeled out of the hospital. I would go on to vomit again a week later, though this time I was left on my own to clear out everything from my mouth. The things I do for my <em>jaw</em>.</p>
