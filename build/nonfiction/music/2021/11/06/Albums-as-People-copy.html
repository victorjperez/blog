    <p><em>A Good Fool - Michael Seyer</em></p>

<p>I remember sitting together in that cramped room. Lights low, music softly playing from your computer. I wasn’t doing much of anything, I never did when you were around. Back when I was recovering from myself you were my entire world, though I’m sure the feeling wasn’t mutual. Just being there in your presence was enough, like sitting at a campfire or a warm stove. I’ll always find happiness in those memories.</p>

<p><em>Trinity - Eartheater</em></p>

<p>There are some people you can look in the eye and only see plastic. Eyes that desperately want to be seen as genuine and caring, but only on the surface. I don’t known if it was the drugs or the loneliness, but something was truly broken in you. When we were alone your clamshell eyes barely cracked, I could never tell if you pitied me or wanted to be pitied. If there were any happiness found in those in those blistering eyes, I had no part in its unearthing.</p>

<p><em>Late - Mixed Matches</em></p>

<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve been in a car alone with someone so long. Watching the expansive land of trees as you drove down the winding and relentless road. We talked about nothing in particular, at least nothing I can remember. Listening to music as we approached some unimportant destination. I think I knew back then, or at least had a feeling that it would be one of the last times we drove somewhere together.</p>

<p><em>Another Life - Amnesia Scanner</em></p>

<p>There are very few people I’d rather not think of. You were one of them, existing at a time I hope to forget.</p>

<p><em>Look Up Sharp - Carla dal Forno</em></p>

<p>When you’re in your early 20s it’s easy to be drawn to anyone that vaguely looks like they have their shit together. Especially someone that’s also exceptionally pretty. And then  time passes and you yourself vaguely get your shit together and you look back and wonder what you were even thinking at the time. Back then I valued things differently. The coldness for those around you may not mean much when you’re planning on simply leaving it all behind. Unfortunately, the way you treat people and they treat you sticks around.</p>

<p><p>Around one year ago I left Morgantown, West Virginia. The amount of people in that town I told about my departure was in the single digits, and on the day of the move only one thought was present: “I cannot be seen.” That attitude defined my return from Washington, DC. I flew into town on an eight person plane the day of the event, and left on that same plane early the next morning. No time was left for wandering the streets of my Alma mater, or loitering in the same coffee shops I used to. Similar to my departure, very few knew of my return, only those at the event itself- a bridal shower and going away party for a close friend of mine.</p>

<p><p>I was going to go on a whole spiel about this quote and how lifechanging/etc it was but I feel like that misses the point so I’ll leave it here so I won’t forget it:</p>
