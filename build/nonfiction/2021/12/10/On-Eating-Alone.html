    <p><em>Today at 7:17 PM</em></p>

<p>Hate it when restaurants put you in the non-reservation side like an undesirable</p>

<p>Anyways at the other fancy Mediterranean restaurant</p>

<p>Might rant might not</p>

<p><!--more--></p>

<p>Something about the portrait museum made me miss West Virginia</p>

<p>The simplicity of it all</p>

<p>Just spending time in shitty houses that were close to collapsing, drinking Hams and PBR</p>

<p>Hanging out at that one bar where I knew everyone</p>

<p>Goin’ out on porches while my friends smoked</p>

<p>But I also remember frequently being afraid</p>

<p>Of running into people I knew but didn’t like</p>

<p>There were too many people back then I didn’t like</p>

<p>And the list increased and increased while all the people I did like gradually left</p>

<p>Until all that was left was the people I didn’t want to see</p>

<p>But I think I miss recognizing people</p>

<p>Right now there’s only a handful of people here I’ve talked to more than once</p>

<p>Yeah I don’t really know where I was going with this</p>

<p>That’s all I guess</p>

<p>Life is long and people are short</p>

<p><em>Today at 7:31 PM</em></p>

<p>Does everyone else in this goddamn restaurant have a reservation??</p>

<p><p><em>A Good Fool - Michael Seyer</em></p>

<p>I remember sitting together in that cramped room. Lights low, music softly playing from your computer. I wasn’t doing much of anything, I never did when you were around. Back when I was recovering from myself you were my entire world, though I’m sure the feeling wasn’t mutual. Just being there in your presence was enough, like sitting at a campfire or a warm stove. I’ll always find happiness in those memories.</p>

<p><p>I was going to go on a whole spiel about this quote and how lifechanging/etc it was but I feel like that misses the point so I’ll leave it here so I won’t forget it:</p>

<p><p><em>This essay was published in Malocclusion: A Post-Bimaxillary Osteotomy Nonfiction Journal, which can be found <a href="https://victorjperez.github.io/malocclusion">here</a></em></p>

<p>In my mind, there are two distinct versions of myself separated by mind and body. As far as the mind is concerned we have Victor II, the current rendition that exists today, and then the Victor that looked into the mirror nine years ago: Victor I. Victor I, birthed of shame and anxiety, exists as a foil to the pride and perfectionism of Victor II. They represent themselves with fear and insecurity, dysmorphia and dysphoria. I’ve lost many years of my life to them, passed over many opportunities. My memories of living as <em>Victor I</em> are hazy unclear, and suppressed. In some ways, parts of <em>Victor I</em> remain inside of me. Upon looking into a mirror, I sometimes see the body of Victor II through the mind of <em>Victor I</em>, not recognizing my form.</p>
