<p>To write creative nonfiction is to let yourself be vulnerable. You lay bare scars that are otherwise invisible, bring out painful memories that would rather be forgotten. Fashion, conversely, focuses on exclusivity and subtly. Fashion exists to hide and act while communicating silently, if at all. As such, finding creative nonfiction on the topic of fashion is nontrivial, and I spent a lot of time searching until I found myself on the homepage of <em>Vestoj.com</em>. The design stood out to me from traditional fashion related websites: it had a simple, ad-free layout. There was a large focus on the text with sparse yet impactful photography, and every article had a diverse set of sources.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>After reading the article <em>Beggars And Choosers</em> by Johannes Lenhard, I was hooked. Lenhard wasn’t just talking about clothes or runway shows. He wrote about poverty, and psychology, and how they could be viewed under the lens of fashion. It’s a rare thing to have a conversation about, and Vestoj housed a goldmine of articles just like it. I wasn’t seeing random people talk about dressing for dates, or the new streetwear “label” (five graphic t-shirts) they were creating. I was seeing the connection between fashion and everyday life.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m explaining it in the most dramatic way possible, if only to mirror the feeling I was overcome with upon my discovery. As soon as the eighth issue, <em>On Authenticity</em>, was released, I paid $30 for a copy and read it cover to cover.</p>

<p>Immediately, the essay <em>Acting As If</em> by Michelle Millar Fisher jumped out at me. It details the link between wearing counterfeit clothing and feeling fake or inauthentic. Beyond that, those emotions influenced the actions of the wearers to be more dishonest, as well as perceiving others as more dishonest. That observation can be extended to individual thoughts and actions of a person; to believe you are something and act like it is to be that thing. This is the basis for cognitive behavioral therapy, which I eventually came to use a great deal to become free of my perceived self.</p>

<p>That same week, I hosted a “No Limits” radio station (A four hour segment of whatever audio content you could dream of), and read the article <em>The Making of a Star</em> by Philippa Snow, another impactful essay on performativity, live on air while Aphex Twin played in the background. I wanted everyone to hear what these people had to say.</p>

<p>Vestoj remains an important part of my life, enough to have a special place in this journal. Nearly everything I write and design, from print to website, is inspired by it. It’s fueled my interest in fashion and society, and even my own writing. I’m grateful to the London College of Fashion for funding it, and for Anja Aronowsky Cronberg for their founding and editing contributions.</p>

<p><em>Vestoj is a forum where academia, the museum world and the fashion industry can work together and with active communication. We write about the cultural phenomenon that is fashion in a manner that opens up for dialogue between theory and practice in order to raise awareness for fashion as a cultural phenomena and field of research and cultivate an even greater understanding for the discipline. Vestoj will exist outside of seasonally-based trends and news-focused articles. Instead we aim to encourage and champion the critical and independent voice within fashion as well as absolute creative freedom. In order to ensure that we remain free in thought and action Vestoj will have no advertising. Vestoj focuses solely on sartorial matters, bringing together academia and industry in a bid to combine academic theory, critical thinking and a bit of good old fashioned glamour.</em></p>

<p>In my mind, there are two distinct versions of myself separated by mind and body. As far as the mind is concerned we have Victor II, the current rendition that exists today, and then the Victor that looked into the mirror nine years ago: Victor I. Victor I, birthed of shame and anxiety, exists as a foil to the pride and perfectionism of Victor II. They represent themselves with fear and insecurity, dysmorphia and dysphoria. I’ve lost many years of my life to them, passed over many opportunities. My memories of living as <em>Victor I</em> are hazy unclear, and suppressed. In some ways, parts of <em>Victor I</em> remain inside of me. Upon looking into a mirror, I sometimes see the body of Victor II through the mind of <em>Victor I</em>, not recognizing my form.</p>

<p>Running from friends. Running from life. Running from family. No matter where I go, I can’t escape. Running from anxiety. Running from reality. Running from my future career. I’ve never been much of an athlete. My legs and my lungs are always in competition of what will give first. Running from my desires, because I felt like I was never worth them. Running from my needs, because other peoples’ were more important. Running is pointless and exhausting. Trying to justify why you’re running is almost as bad as the act of running itself.</p>

<center><b><i>“ My mouth was sewn up ”</i></b></center>

<p>Upon waking up from my surgery, The first thing I noticed was how much I didn’t feel. Everything was numb and bloated. Uncomfortable, but not painful. The second thing I noticed was that I could not open my <em>jaw</em>. Strong elastic bands were attached to the surgical hooks on my braces. The only thing that could force my teeth apart was the strong convulsions that came with me vomiting blood all over myself while resting on my hospital bed. My lips were swollen as if my surgeon bundled in a botox injection with my double <em>jaw</em> surgery.</p>
