<p>In my mind, there are two distinct versions of myself separated by mind and body. As far as the mind is concerned we have Victor II, the current rendition that exists today, and then the Victor that looked into the mirror nine years ago: Victor I. Victor I, birthed of shame and anxiety, exists as a foil to the pride and perfectionism of Victor II. They represent themselves with fear and insecurity, dysmorphia and dysphoria. I’ve lost many years of my life to them, passed over many opportunities. My memories of living as <em>Victor I</em> are hazy unclear, and suppressed. In some ways, parts of <em>Victor I</em> remain inside of me. Upon looking into a mirror, I sometimes see the body of Victor II through the mind of <em>Victor I</em>, not recognizing my form.</p>

<p>Running from friends. Running from life. Running from family. No matter where I go, I can’t escape. Running from anxiety. Running from reality. Running from my future career. I’ve never been much of an athlete. My legs and my lungs are always in competition of what will give first. Running from my desires, because I felt like I was never worth them. Running from my needs, because other peoples’ were more important. Running is pointless and exhausting. Trying to justify why you’re running is almost as bad as the act of running itself.</p>

<center><b><i>“ My mouth was sewn up ”</i></b></center>

<p>Upon waking up from my surgery, The first thing I noticed was how much I didn’t feel. Everything was numb and bloated. Uncomfortable, but not painful. The second thing I noticed was that I could not open my <em>jaw</em>. Strong elastic bands were attached to the surgical hooks on my braces. The only thing that could force my teeth apart was the strong convulsions that came with me vomiting blood all over myself while resting on my hospital bed. My lips were swollen as if my surgeon bundled in a botox injection with my double <em>jaw</em> surgery.</p>

<p><p>During my third year of studying Computer Science, I wanted to vary up my schedule and add an English class to mix things up. I ended up taking Multimedia Writing, an upper-level English class intended for writers and designers. Despite being unnecessary for my degree, that class ended up being an incredibly valuable learning experience for me.</p>

<p><p>As I’ve become more and more experienced as a programmer, one thing has abundantly clear: the less time you spend writing code, the better. Much like writing a book, if you just hop on your computer and start typing, you’ll eventually find yourself tangled in your own work, making something that is more or less impossible to work with. If you chose to continue working on the same poor foundation, more and more time will be spent dedicated to solving problems that you caused, that could have easily been prevent. It is because of this that the majority of my time is spent carefully deciphering what the problem is and planning out how I will solve it.</p>

<p><p>NO MATTER THE INDUSTRY, technology has brought large changes to how things in our society function. The lightning fast pace of technology has hit the music industry in full force, and brought huge change with it. One of the biggest changes has been the introduction of web-based music streaming, where fans can access a huge and growing library of music for a small monthly fee, or even for free with advertisements. This is hugely different from how things worked in the past, where you would need to pay $10 per album in order to listen on demand. Now for around $10 a month, you can access a huge and ever-growing library of music. This is a huge boon for music enthusiasts and general consumers, but what about the artists? How do they make up for the lost revenue? Who eats the loss when it comes to the greatest deal in music? The answer is; eventually everyone. Music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music are a net negative on the music industry as a whole, and are not sustainable in the long term.</p>

<center><b><i>Body Memory</i></b></center>

<p>I remember looking through the cold, empty room. Posters plastered the walls, and stickers lined the desks. I scanned through documents and browsed through files, looking for anything of interest on the events that transpired before my arrival. Amongst the mess, I found packets of macaroni and cheese, a pair of panties, and signs of a herculean effort to keep a college radio station running to the best of its ability. There was a constant effort to keep the dying art of radio alive, and eventually it all came crashing down.</p>

<p><p>Written somewhere on the walls of U92’s DJ staff area is the phrase <em>“College radio is dying, friends are forever.”</em> While I regret to quote the person that uttered it, it remains an unfortunate reality that those in positions of power must confront. WWVU-FM is not an exception. Over one and a half years I associated myself with the station, I searched for a solution. There isn’t one.</p>

<p>To write creative nonfiction is to let yourself be vulnerable. You lay bare scars that are otherwise invisible, bring out painful memories that would rather be forgotten. Fashion, conversely, focuses on exclusivity and subtly. Fashion exists to hide and act while communicating silently, if at all. As such, finding creative nonfiction on the topic of fashion is nontrivial, and I spent a lot of time searching until I found myself on the homepage of <em>Vestoj.com</em>. The design stood out to me from traditional fashion related websites: it had a simple, ad-free layout. There was a large focus on the text with sparse yet impactful photography, and every article had a diverse set of sources.</p>

The vast crowd of adoring fans were preemptively waiting for the biggest sporting event they would ever experience in their entire lives, but this was no ordinary sporting event. The two teams were not competing for goals, nor were they competing for touchdowns or even baskets.
