<p>One day in Seattle Washington, two teams were set to compete for the 2.7 million dollar prize pool in Benaroya Hall.

The two teams were not competing for goals, nor were they competing for touchdowns or even baskets. Each teams’ only aim was to destroy the enemy teams’ ancient, in the third Dota 2 international tournament.</p>

<p><p><strong><em>the following piece is a work from early on in my writing career. It remains largely unedited (since the published date), and largely not fact checked. Published date is an approximation</em></strong></p>

<p>An extraordinarily emotional and classical album, The Crying Light by Antony &amp; The Johnsons seems to recreate several feelings in one fell swoop.</p>
